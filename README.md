# Linked List

This code is a **Linked List ** implemented in C that demonstrates various linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, and display of elements. It supports operations at the front, rear, at a given position, and based on data. It also allows deletion from the front, rear, and based on data.

---

## Features
- **Node Insertion:**
  - Insert a node at the front.
  - Insert a node at the end.
  - Insert a node at a specific position.
  - Insert a node based on existing data.
- **Node Deletion:**
  - Delete a node from the front.
  - Delete a node from the rear.
  - Delete a node based on data.
- **Display List:** Prints the entire list of elements.
- **Memory Management:** Dynamically allocates and deallocates memory for nodes.

---

## Technologies Used
- **C** for implementing the linked list operations.
- **Standard Library**: Uses `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, and `<string.h>` for input/output and memory management.

---

## How to Use
1. Compile and run the C program.
2. The program will present a menu with options to perform different linked list operations.
3. Based on your choice, the program will either insert, delete, or display elements in the linked list.
4. The program allows you to interactively manage a linked list through the console.

## Customization
- Modify the `create_node` function to change how data is inserted into the linked list (e.g., changing the data type).
- Update the `insertion_at_*` and `deletion_at_*` functions to customize insertion and deletion logic.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a doubly linked list to allow traversal in both directions.
- Add support for sorting the linked list.
- Implement more advanced memory management techniques (e.g., using a memory pool).
